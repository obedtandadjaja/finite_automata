# finite_automata
A simple HTML finite automata simulator that I did for fun to help me do my homework for my Computer Theory class.

Built on GoJS and raw Javascript algorithm.

Warning! Because I built this simulator for personal-use and that I was limited on time, this simulator has a lot of room to improve on, especially on its ease-of-use. For this reason, it might be hard for other people to use it since it is quite complicated to use. The code is also not the prettiest and the methods are not modularized, but HEY IT WORKS.
